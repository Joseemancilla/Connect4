# Connect4
Connect 4 game 


Objective: To create a Java-based Connect 4 game that allows a user to play against an AI opponent.

#Features

2-player mode (user vs AI)
AI opponent uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision making
User can select the difficulty level of the AI (Easy, Medium, Hard)
Game board is displayed using a GUI
Allows for undo and redo moves

#Implementation

Use Java Swing for the GUI
Implement the game logic using object-oriented programming principles
Use the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI opponent's decision making
Allow the user to select the difficulty level by adjusting the depth of the minimax algorithm
Implement undo and redo functionality using a stack data structure

#Testing

Test the game for different scenarios such as easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels
Test the undo and redo functionality to ensure it works correctly
Test the AI decision making to ensure it is functioning correctly
Expected outcome: A fully functional Connect 4 game that allows a user to play against an AI opponent with varying difficulty levels and the ability to undo and redo moves.
